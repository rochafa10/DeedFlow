# Investment Scoring System - User Guides

Welcome to the Tax Deed Flow Investment Scoring System documentation. This directory contains comprehensive guides to help you understand and use the 125-point investment scoring system for evaluating tax deed properties.

## Overview

The Investment Scoring System is a comprehensive 125-point framework that evaluates properties across five key categories:
- **Location** (25 points) - Neighborhood quality, accessibility, growth trends
- **Risk** (25 points) - Title issues, environmental concerns, legal complications
- **Financial** (25 points) - Cost-to-value ratio, equity potential, carrying costs
- **Market** (25 points) - Days on market, demand indicators, comparable sales
- **Profit** (25 points) - ROI potential, exit strategies, profit margins

Properties receive a percentage score (score ÷ 125 × 100) and a letter grade (A+ to F) that guides investment decisions.
