### Previous Session Completed:
- Feature #16-23: Properties page and detail features
- Feature #9-15: Dashboard features

### Key Files Created/Modified:
- `src/app/auctions/page.tsx` - NEW: Auction calendar page
- `src/app/orchestration/page.tsx` - Fixed dialog scrolling
- `src/app/properties/page.tsx` - Properties pipeline page

### Architecture Notes:
- The app uses demo credentials for development (demo@taxdeedflow.com / demo123)
- Auth is localStorage-based for now (no real Supabase auth yet)
- Dashboard API returns mock data when Supabase is not configured
- Auctions page uses mock auction data
- Sessions are stored in React state (not persisted to DB)

### Known Issues:
- Supabase is not configured (missing env vars) - using mock data mode
- Auth uses demo credentials only (no real user registration)
- Session data resets on page refresh (state-based, not DB)

### Next Steps:
1. Continue with auction-related features (filtering, navigation)
2. Work on remaining orchestration features
3. Add more interactivity to existing pages

### Server Running On:
- Port 3001 (3000 was in use)
- Start with: `npm run dev`

### Git Status:
- Branch: main (ahead of origin/main)
- Multiple uncommitted changes ready to commit
