# - Production: Generate a secure random string using one of these methods:
#   1. Node.js: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
#   2. OpenSSL: openssl rand -hex 32
#   3. Online tool: https://1password.com/password-generator/
#
# SECURITY: Keep this secret! Anyone with this key can trigger expensive scraping operations.
