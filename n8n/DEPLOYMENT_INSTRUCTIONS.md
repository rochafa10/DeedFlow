# ðŸš€ Super-Smart Workflow Deployment Instructions

## âœ… Deployment Complete!

The following workflows have been deployed to your n8n instance:

1. **Super-Smart Calendar Scraper** - The ultimate AI + Python hybrid
2. **AI Calendar Scraper Agent** - AI-powered extraction with tools
3. **Python-Enhanced Calendar Scraper** - Python processing with PDF support

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps

### 1. Configure Credentials in n8n

Go to your n8n instance and add these credentials:

#### OpenAI (Required)
1. Go to Credentials > Add Credential > OpenAI
2. Enter your API key: `sk-...`
3. Name it: "OpenAI"

#### Anthropic (Optional but recommended)
1. Go to Credentials > Add Credential > Anthropic
2. Enter your API key: `sk-ant-...`
3. Name it: "Anthropic"

#### Supabase (Required)
1. Go to Credentials > Add Credential > Supabase
2. URL: Your Supabase project URL
3. Service Role Key: From Supabase dashboard
4. Name it: "Supabase Tax Deed"

### 2. Install Python Packages

If using Python nodes, ensure these packages are available:
```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 pandas numpy matplotlib python-dateutil PyPDF2 requests
```

Or configure n8n to auto-install:
```
N8N_PYTHON_PACKAGES=beautifulsoup4,pandas,numpy,matplotlib,python-dateutil,PyPDF2,requests
```

### 3. Activate Workflows

1. Open each workflow in n8n
2. Click "Activate" toggle
3. Verify the schedule trigger is set correctly

### 4. Test the Workflows

#### Test Super-Smart Scraper
```bash
# Manually execute in n8n UI
# Or wait for scheduled trigger (every 2 hours)
```

#### Monitor Execution
```sql
-- Check extraction results in Supabase
SELECT * FROM auctions 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check learning patterns
SELECT * FROM learning_patterns
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 5. Monitor Performance

#### Cost Tracking
- Super-Smart: ~$0.12 per county per run
- AI Agent: ~$0.09 per county per run
- Python Enhanced: ~$0.10 per county per run

#### Success Metrics
```sql
-- Check extraction success rate
SELECT 
  county,
  AVG(confidence_score) as avg_confidence,
  COUNT(*) as extraction_count
FROM extraction_logs
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY county;
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Optimization Tips

1. **Start with one county** to test and validate
2. **Monitor confidence scores** - should be >0.8
3. **Check learning patterns** weekly
4. **Adjust schedules** based on auction frequency
5. **Review costs** in OpenAI/Anthropic dashboards

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Workflow Fails to Execute
- Check credentials are configured correctly
- Verify Supabase connection
- Check n8n logs for specific errors

### Low Confidence Scores
- Let the system learn for a few runs
- Check if county website changed
- Review extraction_logs for patterns

### High API Costs
- Reduce frequency of scheduled triggers
- Use GPT-3.5 instead of GPT-4 where possible
- Enable caching in workflow settings
