**LFB Investments LLC | Tax Deed & Tax Lien Acquisitions**

---

## Overview

This guide provides a systematic approach to running accurate property comparables (comps) following professional appraisal standards. Accurate comping is critical for determining After Repair Value (ARV) and making profitable investment decisions in tax deed and tax lien acquisitions.

### Why Follow Appraisal Rules?

- Buyers and lenders require appraisal-compliant valuations
- Consistent methodology eliminates guesswork and emotional pricing
- Protects against overpaying or missing profitable opportunities
- Ensures your deals close without appraisal surprises

---

## The 9-Step Comping Process

### Step 1: Comp Age (180 Days Maximum)

**Rule:** Only use comps that closed within the last 6 months (180 days).

- Fresh comps reflect current market conditions
- Older comps may not account for market shifts
- If you MUST use older comps, reduce ARV by 10-20%

> ⚠️ **Exception:** In slow markets with limited sales, you may extend to 9-12 months but apply a market adjustment.

---

### Step 2: Stay Within the Subdivision

**Rule:** Never cross major roads or geographic boundaries when pulling comps.

- Different subdivisions have different values even if they look similar
- HOA differences, school districts, and neighborhood perception affect values
- Major roads create natural value boundaries

> 💡 **Tip:** If you must go outside the subdivision, stay within 1 mile and adjust for location differences.

---

### Step 3: Square Footage (±250 sq ft)

**Rule:** Select comps within ±250 square feet of your subject property.

- Larger differences require price-per-square-foot adjustments
- A 1,500 sq ft house should be compared to 1,250-1,750 sq ft homes
- Some appraisers allow ±300 sq ft in certain markets

---

### Step 4: Year Built (±10 Years)

**Rule:** Compare properties built within 10 years of your subject property.

- Newer homes have modern layouts, systems, and finishes
- Older homes may need more maintenance and updates
- If extending the range, account for additional maintenance costs

---

### Step 5: Property Type Must Match

**Rule:** Compare like with like. Single-family to single-family, condo to condo.

- Never compare a single-family home to a townhouse or condo
- Manufactured homes should only be compared to manufactured homes
- Multi-family properties require multi-family comps

---

### Step 6: Lot Size (±2,500 sq ft)

**Rule:** Compare properties with lot sizes within 2,500 square feet of each other.

- Lot size significantly impacts value, especially in urban areas
- Corner lots and irregular lots may need adjustments
- Acreage properties have different valuation rules

---

### Step 7: Bedroom & Bathroom Count Adjustments

**Rule:** Adjust ARV by $10,000-$25,000 for bedroom or bathroom differences.

| Feature Difference | Adjustment Range |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Per Bedroom | ±$10,000 - $25,000 |
| Per Full Bathroom | ±$10,000 - $20,000 |
| Per Half Bathroom | ±$5,000 - $10,000 |

**Note:** Adjustments vary by market. Higher-end markets may require larger adjustments.

---

### Step 8: Garage & Pool Adjustments (Climate-Based)

**Rule:** Add $10,000-$25,000 for garages or pools based on climate.

| Climate Type | Garage Adjustment | Pool Adjustment |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Moderate Climate | +$10,000 | +$10,000 |
| Extreme Climate (Hot/Cold) | +$20,000 - $25,000 | +$20,000 - $25,000 |

> 💡 **PA/MD/DE Markets:** For LFB's target markets, use moderate climate adjustments. Garages are more valuable in colder areas.

---

### Step 9: Market Condition Adjustments

**Rule:** Adjust ARV based on current market trends and buyer sentiment.

| Market Condition | ARV Adjustment | Indicators |
|-----------------|----------------|------------|
| **Hot Market (Seller's)** | +$10,000 - $25,000 | Low inventory, multiple offers, quick sales |
| **Stable Market** | No adjustment | Balanced inventory, normal DOM |
| **Declining Market (Buyer's)** | -$10,000 - $25,000 | High inventory, price reductions, long DOM |

> ⚠️ **Critical:** Always check inventory trends over the last 3-6 months to determine market direction.

---

## ARV Calculation Formula

### The Formula

```
ARV = Avg. Price Per Sq Ft of Comps × Subject Property Sq Ft
```

### The 70% Rule (Maximum Allowable Offer)

```
MAO = (ARV × 70%) - Repair Costs
```

### Example Calculation

- **Subject Property:** 1,500 sq ft
- **Avg. Price/Sq Ft from Comps:** $150
- **ARV** = 1,500 × $150 = **$225,000**
- **Estimated Repairs:** $40,000
- **MAO** = ($225,000 × 70%) - $40,000 = **$117,500**

> 📌 **For Tax Deed Auctions:** Consider using 60-65% of ARV to account for additional risks and holding costs associated with tax deed properties.
