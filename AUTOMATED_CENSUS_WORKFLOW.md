2. **Click on any Postgres node** (Check Schema, Update Schema, or Update Counties)

3. **Create new credentials** with these settings:
   ```
   Connection Type: Postgres

   Port: 5432
   SSL: Required (Enable SSL/TLS)
   ```

4. **Name the credentials**: "Supabase Postgres"

5. **Save and test** the connection

## 🎯 Running the Workflow

### First Run (Complete Setup)
1. Click "Execute Workflow" button
2. The workflow will:
   - Check if business columns exist
   - Create missing columns automatically
   - Add performance indexes
   - Fetch Census data for all states
   - Update all counties with business data
   - Generate a summary report

**Expected time:** 3-5 minutes for all states

### Subsequent Runs
- Simply click "Execute Workflow"
- Schema checks are fast (skip if columns exist)
- Only data updates are performed

## 📈 Data Added to Counties Table

| Column | Description | Type |
|--------|-------------|------|
| business_establishments | Number of businesses | INTEGER |
| business_employees | Total employees | INTEGER |
| business_payroll_annual | Annual payroll ($1000s) | BIGINT |
| census_fips_code | Census county code | VARCHAR(5) |
| business_data_year | Data year (2023) | INTEGER |
| business_data_updated | Last update timestamp | TIMESTAMP |

## 🔍 Verify Results

### Check Updated Counties
```sql
-- View enriched counties
SELECT 
    name,
    state_code,
    business_establishments,
    business_employees,
    business_payroll_annual,
    business_data_updated
FROM counties
WHERE business_data_updated IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY business_data_updated DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Get Statistics by State
```sql
-- Summary by state
SELECT 
    state_code,
    COUNT(*) as total_counties,
    AVG(business_establishments) as avg_establishments,
    SUM(business_employees) as total_employees
FROM counties
WHERE business_establishments IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY state_code
ORDER BY total_employees DESC;
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Postgres node shows error"
- Ensure credentials are configured correctly
- Check SSL is enabled
- Verify Supabase password is correct

### "No data returned from Census"
- The Census API might be temporarily down
- Check the API key is valid: 059814072c853cf2c2c996f264d00b456f04979d

### "Counties not updating"
- Check county names match between Census and your database
- Review the summary node for specific errors

## 📅 Schedule Automatic Updates

To run monthly:
1. Add a "Schedule Trigger" node
2. Set to run on 1st of each month
3. Connect to "Check Schema" node
4. Activate the workflow
